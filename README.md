# Farkel Scorekeeper
This is a basic command-line interface for a scorekeeper for [Farkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).

My family and I play this game somewhat often, so I figured that it would be easier to keep track of the score on a computer than on paper. Plus, now we can measure statistics and look at nice graphs.

If you want to use this, clone the repository, navigate to its directory, and run `./farkel.py`. It'll give you some prompts, and you can follow along from there.
